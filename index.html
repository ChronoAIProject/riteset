            <h3>2. Lawful Basis for Processing</h3>
            <p>We process your personal data only when we have a legal basis to do so, including:</p>

                <li><strong>Contractual Necessity:</strong> Where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract (e.g., managing your Premium subscription).</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> Where we must comply with the law (e.g., tax or law enforcement requests).</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> For our business interests, such as improving our AI models and ensuring App security.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>General Location:</strong> Derived from IP address to ensure regional compliance and security.</li>

            <h3>4. Use of Personal Data</h3>
            <p>We leverage your data to provide a hyper-personalized experience:</p>

            <p>We do not sell your personal data. We share information only with:</p>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>6. Transfer of Information</h3>
            <p>Your information is processed at our operating offices in Singapore and in any other place where the parties involved in processing are located. This means your data may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of your jurisdiction where data protection laws may differ.</p>
            <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
            <p>We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and no transfer of your personal data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.</p>
            
            <h3>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We retain your Personal Data only for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy. No purpose in this Policy will require us to keep your information for longer than 2 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Deletion Rights:</strong> You have the right to delete or request assistance in deleting the Personal Data we have collected. You may update or delete your information at any time by signing into your account settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation or lawful basis to do so (e.g., tax or accounting requirements).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>8. Your Privacy Rights (GDPR/CCPA/PDPA)</h3>
            <p>Depending on your location (e.g., Singapore PDPA, EU GDPR, or California CCPA), you may have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access & Portability:</strong> Request a copy of the data we hold about you.</li>
                <li><strong>Correction & Deletion:</strong> Update inaccurate info or request total deletion of your account.</li>
                <li><strong>Withdraw Consent:</strong> Stop data processing by deleting your account or contacting us.</li>

            <p>To exercise these rights, please visit your account settings or contact us via our Instagram page (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/riteset.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.instagram.com/riteset.app/</a>).</p>
            
            <h3>9. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or 16 in the EEA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information and terminate the child's account.</p>
            
            <h3>10. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h3>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Policy.</p>
            
            <h3>11. Security Measures</h3>
